## Overview

This project explores a novel multimodal machine learning approach for the challenging task of speech restoration from severely degraded audio. Traditional methods often struggle with complex real-world distortions like noise, clipping, and missing segments. Our work aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging the complementary information present in both audio signals and the visual context of lip movements. By integrating these modalities within a hybrid machine learning system, we strive to achieve more robust and accurate speech restoration, paving the way for improved outcomes in various applications.

## Key Features

* **Multimodal Approach:** Integrates audio and visual (lip movement) data for enhanced speech understanding and restoration.
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Combines the strengths of different machine learning models, including Speech-to-Text (STT), Language Model (LLM), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and a Lip-Reading model.
* **Robustness to Degradation:** Designed to handle common audio distortions such as noise, clipping, and missing speech segments.
* **Contextual Awareness:** Utilizes a Language Model to understand the semantic context and potentially fill in missing information.
* **Trained on the GRID Corpus:** Evaluated using the clean and synchronized audiovisual GRID dataset.
* **Data Augmentation:** Employs techniques like simulated clipping, noise injection, and audio degradation to improve model generalization.

## Real-World Applications

The ability to effectively restore degraded speech has significant implications for:

* **Preserving Cultural Heritage:** Recovering audio from old or damaged historical recordings.
* **Forensic Analysis:** Enhancing the clarity of crucial audio evidence in investigations.
* **Improving Accessibility:** Making spoken content understandable for individuals with hearing impairments.
* **Audio Post-Production:** Cleaning up noisy or flawed audio in film, television, and other media.

## Technical Details

Our system utilizes the following key components:

* **Speech-to-Text (STT):** `wav2vec2.0` for transcribing degraded audio.
* **Language Model (LLM):** `DistilGPT2` for contextual understanding and gap filling.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** `Tacotron2-DDC` for synthesizing the restored speech.
* **Lip-Reading:** `LipNet` for extracting visual information from lip movements.
